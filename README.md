# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Using a deep-learning neural network to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations. 


## Background
*Alphabet Soup* is a non-profit philanthropic foundation dedicated to helping organizations that protect the environment, improve people's well-being, and unify the world. <br>

In the past 20 years, *Alphabet Soup* has raised and donated over 10 billion dollars. This money has been used to invest in life-saving technologies and organize reforestation groups worldwide. <br>

Unfortunately, not every donation the company makes is impactful. In some cases, an organization will take the money and disappear. As a result, *Alphabet Soup* president, Andy Glad, wishes to implement a new method to predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk. <br>
He is interested in a mathematical data-driven solution that can do this accurately. <br>

For that purpose, the company's senior data scientist, who is in charge of data collection and analysis for the entire organization, has requested an analysis of the impact of each donation and a new method to vet potential recipients. This analysis will help ensure that the foundation's money is used effectively. <br>

*Alphabet Soup*'s business team has provided a CSV data file that contains more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. <br>
Within this dataset are several columns that capture metadata about each organization and can be used as features to train the predictive model. <br>

### Purpose
The analysis of previous donation records and vetting of potential recipient organizations is too complex for regular statistical and machine learning models. <br>
Instead, we will design and train a deep learning neural network. This model will evaluate all types of input data and produce a clear decision-making result. <br>
Specifically, we will create a binary classifier capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Objectives
1. Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model.
2. Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. Optimize the Model.
